Considering this is an animation and VFX assignment, I decided to focus on specific gameobjects that would be enhanced through the inclusion of these features. 
For animation, I added a rotation property to the security cameras. This addition gives them a more natural feel compared to the stiff objects they were beforehand. It wasn't too difficult to implement the animation, 
but for some reason adding a new keyframe would always add a "position" property. This shifted the base of the camera (the part I was animating) a little, making the keyframes not blend as easily.
Simply deleting this property fixed this problem.
Another animation I added was for the jetpack powerup. I made it bob up and down as well as spinning it around in a 360-degree rotation. This inclusion gives more impact for the player to notice it as well as being 
nice to look at.
Both of these animations were made by me.
The VFX were added in two areas; the fallen barrels and the jetpack. The VFX for the barrels are green, smoke-like particles that flow out of the openings of the two objects in the environment. The particle's texture 
comes from the pre-installed microgame files. The only trouble I had was finding the right shape that would fit the expulsion effect I was going for (like a leak). The other effect on the jetpack is a sphere particle
effect, using pre-installed star textures with a yellow tint to enhanced the "wow" factor of finding the powerup.
