We made one major and minor modification to the game
Major - We added a timer that rapidly counts down to zero. When it reaches it, the game is considered a loss and the player restrarts in their starting position
The timer will also glow red as an indicator of time being up. This makes the game more tense as the player now needs to rush towards the exit while the timer
counts down. It also increases the oppurtunity for mistakes.

Minor -  We changed the behavior of the Gargoyle enemies in the game. Their static nature made them too easy to deal with, especially with their placements. So,
we decided to give them a rotation as well as an increased detection capsule collider. This makes them more threatning as well as more interesting for the player.
